<sub>(No longer for smiting management)</sub>

## Overview
Smiko is a collection of reverse engineered software and tools regarding the Google Security Chip. The tools in this repository are designed to interact with and in some cases exploit Google's lineup of chips to perform custom actions, extract data, and more.

The Google Security Chip (TM) is Google's proprietary off-shelf SoC that runs alongside the main processor in millions of licensed products (primarily Chromebooks, Google Pixel Phones, and Google's physical servers), serving a suite of hardware and software protection mechanisms to enable maximum control of the device on the hardware level whilst also preventing malicious tampering. Smiko aims to open-source this technology for security researchers to be able to understand and work with, and lead to overall improvement of this technology as time advances.

You can see a writeup of Smiko on [the website](https://smiko.havenoverflow.dev).

## Utilities Usage
There are many ways by which Smiko (and all software contained in this repo) can be utilized, of which here are the most straight-forward:
- [RMA Shim](/docs/rma_shim.md) (Safest, Recommended): Use Smiko or [RMASmoke](https://github.com/fWNavy/RMASmoke) using the TPM link existing on a modified RMA shim running in recovery mode.
- [Recovery Image](/docs/reco_image.md) ~~(Universal): Use Smiko or [RMASmoke](https://github.com/fWNavy/RMASmoke) using the TPM link existing on a patched Recovery Image.~~ (This will be replaced by Recomm3r, a project by crosbreaker that provides a GUI to modified recovery images)
- [SuzyQ](/docs/suzyq.md) (Universal, Recommended): Use Smiko using a GSC Debug Accessory and a piece of software.
- [Servo/C2D2](/docs/servo.md) (Universal): Use Smiko or Shaft using a Servo/C2D2 hardware header (Requires soldering skill!)
- [Developer Mode](/docs/devmode.md): Use Smiko or [RMASmoke](https://github.com/fWNavy/RMASmoke) using the command line on a Chromebook in Developer Mode (Cannot be done whilst enrolled _unless_ you're running [Shimboot](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot) or a similar alternative).

All of the above installation means provide a universal method of using Smiko's tools on virtually any device.

More information can be found in the [docs folder](/docs), it is highly recommended you read all of them before continuing so you know what to expect and what your best option is.

## Reverse-Engineered Software
Smiko also contains decompilations of a lot of software that runs on the Google Security Chip lineup. Here is the full list of decompiled code, as well as paths to find them:
- [H1 BootROM](https://github.com/HavenOverflow/Cr50/tree/main/chip/haven/rom): Extracted and Decompiled copy of the Haven GSC BootROM (leaked via [RMASmoke](https://github.com/fWNavy/RMASmoke))
- [Cr50 RO](https://github.com/HavenOverflow/Cr50/tree/main/chip/haven/loader): Carved and Decompiled copy of the Cr50 RO firmware (NOT the same as chip/g/loader in chromium's source code)
- [Ti50](https://github.com/HavenOverflow/Ti50): Full decompilation of Ti50 for both Dauntless and OpenTitan, as well as custom implementations for Haven and Host-Emulation
- [Nugget-OS](https://github.com/HavenOverflow/nugget-os): Decompilation of Nugget-OS for Citadel and by extension the Acropora RTOS for Dauntless
- [Shaft](https://github.com/HavenOverflow/Smiko/tree/main/src/shaft): Custom reimplementation of the rescue and spiflash utilities from the closed-source cr50-utils repository (see docs for more info)

## Release Timeline
Smiko's full open-sourcing will be split up into 3 major releases, to allow development to continue without delaying further updates:
- Release 1: **Cr50 Loader**: Release all smiko utilities and the H1 BootROM and RO source code + binaries
- Release 2: **Nugget-OS**: Release updated smiko utilities and the C2 BootROM, RO, and Nugget-OS source code + binaries, Release D3 Acropora RO and RW source code + binaries
- Release 3: **Ti50**: Release updated smiko utilities and the D3 BootROM, RO, and Ti50 source code + binaries

This is currently Release 1, and thus you may run in to errors when attempting to clone the Ti50 and Nugget-OS repositories. Neither of these repositories are required to run `make all`. Releases 2 and 3 are in progress, you can join the discord public server (placed below) to stay posted.

Note: To all HOv staff members, please do not publish the Nugget-OS or Ti50 releases until properly completed.
